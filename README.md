# learnGit
This is a remote repository. It is intended for learning git best practices.

What I have learned here ?
What is local repository
What is remote repository
what is a branch
What is a commit
How to work in such way that I don't break anyone else work.
I have learned more about rebase
I have also learned how to merge a branch
I have learned that merging in a non-fast-forward way is much better than merging fast forward.
And many more ... ;)
